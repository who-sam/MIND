# Final Project Proposal: Multi-Pod Note Management Application

---

## Project Overview

The **Multi-Pod Note Management Application** is a fully containerized full-stack web platform for creating, editing, and managing notes. It integrates a **React frontend**, **Flask backend**, and **MariaDB database**, deployed on a **multi-node Kubernetes cluster** provisioned via **kubeadm** and automated with **Ansible**. This project demonstrates complete DevOps lifecycle practicesâ€”from infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD automation to monitoring, alerting, and scalability.

The system simulates a **production-grade DevOps environment**, ensuring resilience, observability, and maintainability while leveraging modern cloud-native technologies.
